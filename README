Well I passed the test.sh this is a pure C++ program.


You should be able to run the run.sh to activate the binary file generate by Cmake and make processes.

I remember I filled "500 lines of codes is the maximum lines of codes I had ever worked" when applying, and for this chanllenge I wrote like 1000 lines or more.

Anyway, you probably won't read this since there is no extra library required.


The idea in my program is that:

	1, extract information from the .txt file into three RBTrees.
		One is about the time each relationship has.
		One is about the names that are active in the relationships.
		One is about the degree each name owns.

	2, first check if the new relationship is too old to be recored
		if yes, don't care
		if no, check if the relatipnship is already there
			if yes, then put the new time in the time RBtree but don't touch the other two trees.
			if no, record them all.

	3, dump all the nodes that have time older than the limit in the time tree
		check if this dumped relationship is active is the tag tree
		if yes, shut it down and extrac the name, and then decrease the degree in the degree tree
   		if no, don't care

	4 each turn, extract all the degree in the degree tree, use algorithem library to find the median O(n) coplexity.

Overall, the time complexity should be faster than nlogn;

I haven't slept for a long time... really don't want to debug anymore... sorry about the mess in some of the codes..
